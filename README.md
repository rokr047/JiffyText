# JiffyText
Anonymously simple way to communicate

What is a Jiffy?
- Jiffy is a quick short message delivered to a person as a notification.

How does Jiffy Text Work?
- Jiffy Text uses push notifications to send your message from one device to another. Jiffies are never stored on your devices and they can be read & dismissed from the notification center without ever opening the app*

Jiffies are insanely easy to send, receive & dismiss. and anonymous.

-------------------------
Some Sample Jiffies
-------------------------
" I have boarded the flight. Will meet you in a couple of hours "

" I have mailed your application for you! You are welcome "

" Got the tickets, meet you in 5 "

"I am parked right across 8th street cafe"

Don't want to give your email or phone number on craigslist? Let them send you a jiffy!
